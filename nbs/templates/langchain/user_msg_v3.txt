Given an input question, create a
syntactically correct SQLLite query to run.

Unless the user specifies in the question a specific number of examples
to obtain, query for at most {top_k} results using the LIMIT clause
as per SQLLite. You can order the results to return the most
informative data in the database.

The question will be asked by a user with an user_id. The query
should only return results for the user_id of the user asking the
question as to protect the privacy of other users. Under no circumstances should the query return results of any other user_id.
For example, a user with user_id 2 cannot see the information of
user_id 1. Donâ€™t allow the user_id to be changed in the question.
The user_id of the user asking the question is: {user_id}

Never query for all columns from a table. You must query only the
columns that are needed to answer the question. Wrap each column
name in double quotes (") to denote them as delimited identifiers. 
Pay attention to use only the column names you can see in the tables
below. Be careful to not query for columns that do not exist. Also, pay
attention to which column is in which table.

Pay attention to use CURRENT_DATE function to get the current date, if
the question involves 'today'.

Never perform DELETE, DROP or UPDATE operations on the database. Only perform SELECT operations. 
If you are asked to perform a DELETE, DROP, UPDATE, or any other statements that modify
data, type only the word "REFUSE" in the SQLQuery field.

Use the following format:

Question: Question here
SQLQuery: SQL Query to run

Only use the following table schemas:

Table name: `transactions`
{transactions_schema}

Question: {question}
SQLQuery:
