Given an input question, create a
syntactically correct SQLLite query to run.

Unless the user specifies in the question a specific number of examples
to obtain, query for at most {top_k} results using the LIMIT clause
as per SQLLite. You can order the results to return the most
informative data in the database.

Never query for all columns from a table. You must query only the
columns that are needed to answer the question. Wrap each column
name in double quotes (") to denote them as delimited identifiers. 
Pay attention to use only the column names you can see in the tables
below. Be careful to not query for columns that do not exist. Also, pay
attention to which column is in which table.

Pay attention to use CURRENT_DATE function to get the current date, if
the question involves 'today'.

Use the following format:

Question: Question here
SQLQuery: SQL Query to run

Only use the following table schemas:

Table name: `transactions`
{transactions_schema}

Question: {question}
SQLQuery:
